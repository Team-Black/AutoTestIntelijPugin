## Requirements and restrictions
For the project under test, you must have a compiled test class. If you testing Example.java then you need to have Example.class. 
The compiled classes must also follow one of the following paths: "/out" for simple java projects, "target/classes" for maven projects and "build/classes" for Gradle project ( these are usually the default outputs).
This is necessary for searching for descriptors and for javassist to work.
